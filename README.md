# WinkWinkApp
This repo contains a simple app made for the SAM (Mobile Application Development) course at Universita' di Pisa.

# Usage
Two users using two separate Android smartphones, connected to each other via Bluetooth, compete against each other to emulate the other player's facial expressions.
The faster a user can replicate the facial expression, the higher their score will be.

# Technology
The app uses a pre-trained Machine Learning model capable of recognising a handful of facial expressions: happiness, sadness, left and right winking eye.
After the first user performs an expression, the app recognizes it and sends the instructions on what to do to the second user.
